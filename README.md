# WHAT IS ROW PLANTER?
row planter is a skript plugin that plants a row of crops.
it can also place a line of rails or fences or most other blocks.

TUTORIAL
stand at one end of your field 

COMMANDS
//rowplace

ONE CLICK MODE

PERMISSIONS
you will need to add a few permissions to your permissions plugin. ie. permisionsEx, SkPerms.
If your running a spigot server and you don't know what permissions are then you need to learn what they are and how to use them. i would say its the most important thing to know when it comes to bukket servers.
 
I recommend adding these permissions to users or members type groups:
- skript.row.user.*
- skript.row.user

I recommend adding these permissions to builders or admin type groups:
- skript.row.admin.*
- skript.row.admin

Here is the full list of permissions and what they allow:
- skript.row.user.help - allows use of /row help
- skript.row.user.plant - allows use of /row plant
- skript.row.user.place - allows use of /row place
- skript.row.user.oneclick - allows use of /row oneclick
- skript.row.admin.free - allows use of /row free

DEPENDENCIES
Row Planter depends on tim740's skAliases, which if you don't have and you skript you should get anyway.
